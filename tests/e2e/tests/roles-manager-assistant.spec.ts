/**
 * roles-manager-assistant - chains R2 and R3 of the E2E plan (section 3).
 *
 * R2: an ADELE manager sees and edits every learning path, including ones
 *     somebody else created.
 * R3: an assistant edits exactly the paths they were made an editor of -
 *     and no others.
 *
 * Both are checked on the EFFECT, not on the menu: the test changes the path
 * and reloads. A visible edit button proves nothing if the save is refused,
 * and a missing one proves nothing if the route still works.
 *
 * The fixtures give the assistant an editor assignment on exactly one path
 * (Linear A2) through local_adele's own API, so the pair "may edit" and
 * "may not edit" exists for the same person at the same moment.
