/**
 * Time values of the "timed" access condition (issue #581).
 *
 * A window is stored as two Unix timestamps and compared as integers. Earlier
 * versions stored the wall-clock string of an <input type="datetime-local">
 * ("2026-12-01T10:00"), which has no time zone and was parsed with
 * createFromFormat() - filling the missing seconds from the CURRENT second, so
 * the outcome at a boundary depended on when the check happened to run.
 *
 * The window is half-open: open from the first second of its start, closed
 * from the first second of its end.
 *
 *     start <= now < end
 *
 * That is the behaviour the old code showed in practice, so existing paths keep
 * their meaning; it is now a decision written down rather than a side effect.
